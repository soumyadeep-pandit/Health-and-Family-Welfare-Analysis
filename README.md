# 📊 Health and Family Welfare Analysis 🏥  

## 📝 Overview  
This project utilizes **Tableau** to analyze childhood diseases (**Pneumonia, Diarrhoea, Measles, and Asthma**) in India based on *Health Management & Information System (HMIS)* reports from **2018-19 and 2019-20**. The analysis helps **Department of Health Research, India** make **data-driven decisions** to combat childhood diseases by identifying high-risk areas and mortality trends.  

## 🎯 Key Objectives  
✔️ **Integrate Data Across Years** – Merge **2018-19 & 2019-20** datasets  
✔️ **Handle Missing Data** – Replace null values to maintain data accuracy  
✔️ **Filter Key Parameters** – Focus on childhood disease trends  
✔️ **Visualize Insights using Tableau** – Create interactive dashboards  

## 📌 Key Insights  
🔹 **Regional Disparities:** High disease prevalence in **Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh**.  
🔹 **Urban vs Rural Divide:** Rural areas experience **significantly higher incidences**.  
🔹 **Mortality Causes:** **Pneumonia (62.95%)** and **Diarrhoea (33.29%)** contribute to most childhood deaths.  
🔹 **Action Plan:** Focus on **rural healthcare, immunization programs, and improved infrastructure**.  

## 📈 Methodology
